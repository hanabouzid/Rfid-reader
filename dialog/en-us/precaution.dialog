Practice good hand hygiene and minimize how often you touch your face. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol before touching your face or eating. When using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure to rub it in until your hands are completely dry.Avoid touching surfaces with fingertips. Your fingertips are the part of your hand most likely to transmit a virus, because theyâ€™re the part most often used to touch your nose or mouth.Instead of a finger, use an object such as a pen, or even your knuckle, to press an elevator button. Open doors with an elbow or the back of a hand.Carry a pack of single-use tissues,You can use these to open a door or grab a handrail.
